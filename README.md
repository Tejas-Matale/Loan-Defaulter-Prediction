# Loan-Defaulter-Prediction

<h2>Loan Defaulter Prediction</h2>
A deep learning-based project that predicts loan defaulters using real-world financial data. This project includes end-to-end implementation: from Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and visualization.

Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python

Libraries/Frameworks:
Pandas, NumPy – Data handling
Seaborn, Matplotlib – Visualization
Scikit-learn – Preprocessing
TensorFlow, Keras – Deep Learning

Preprocessing
Missing Values: Imputed based on EDA findings.
Categorical Features: Handled using One-Hot Encoding.
Feature Scaling: Applied MinMaxScaler to normalize numerical features.
